Itak
====
This is program was designed and written by Yoitsu Kamijo in effort to help the preservation of the Itak language, 
which is spoken by the Ainu people of northern Japan who have a rich oral tradition despite the lack of a writing system. 
This transcriber uses a set of modified kataka scripts to denote the sounds of the Itak language so that in the future 
stories of the Ainus can be archived and preserved in written forms.
